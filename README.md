1. **Create an Input File**:
   - Create a file named `input.txt` in the same directory where the JAR file (`MyProgram.jar`) is located. This file will be used as input for the program.

2. **Install Java**:
   - Ensure that Java is installed on your machine. If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from [this link](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

3. **Run the JAR File**:
   - Open a terminal, command prompt, PowerShell, or the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the directory where the JAR file (`MyProgram.jar`) is located.
   - Execute the following command to run the JAR file:

   ```bash
   java -jar MyProgram.jar
   ```
4. **View the Output**:
   - The program will read the input from the `input.txt` file, process it, and display the output in the terminal as well as write to an output folder.
